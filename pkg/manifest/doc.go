// Package manifest provides functionality for loading, saving, and managing
// ai.package.yaml manifest files for project-level resource dependencies.
//
// Similar to npm's package.json, ai.package.yaml allows projects to declare
// which AI resources (commands, skills, agents, packages) should be installed.
