# E2E Test Configuration
# This config is used for end-to-end testing of aimgr CLI
# It uses a test-specific repository path

install:
    targets:
        - claude
        - opencode

repo:
  # Use relative path to test repo within test/e2e/repos/
  # This directory is git-ignored and created fresh for each test run
  # Path is relative to the config file location (test/e2e/configs/)
  path: ../repos/test-repo-1

# Note: Sync sources are configured per-repository via ai.repo.yaml
# E2E tests use setupTestRepoWithSources() to create ai.repo.yaml with test sources
