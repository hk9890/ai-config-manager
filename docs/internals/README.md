# Internals

This section contains implementation details for curious users and contributors. These documents are **not required** for normal usage of aimgr.

## Who This Is For

- **Contributors** who want to understand how aimgr works internally
- **Power users** curious about implementation details
- **Debuggers** troubleshooting specific behaviors

## Contents

- [Repository Layout](repository-layout.md) - Internal folder structure of an aimgr repository
- [Workspace Caching](workspace-caching.md) - How the `.workspace/` cache optimizes Git operations
- [Git Tracking](git-tracking.md) - How aimgr tracks repository changes with Git

## Not Required for Normal Usage

If you're just getting started with aimgr, you don't need to read these documents. The [User Guide](../user-guide/README.md) covers everything you need to know for day-to-day usage.

These internals docs explain the "how" behind features, not the "what" or "why" - which are covered in the user guide.
