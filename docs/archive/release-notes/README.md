# Historical Release Notes

This directory contains archived release notes from previous versions of aimgr (ai-config-manager).

## About These Files

These files are historical documentation of release announcements. They have been archived to keep the root directory clean while preserving the history of the project.

## Current Release Information

For current and future release information, please refer to:

- **[CHANGELOG.md](../../../CHANGELOG.md)** - Active changelog in the root directory
- **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hk9890/ai-config-manager/releases)** - Official release page with binaries and auto-generated release notes
- **[docs/RELEASE.md](../../RELEASE.md)** - Release process documentation

## Archived Versions

- **v0.3.0** - GitHub Source Support

## Why Archived?

With the adoption of GoReleaser and GitHub Actions, release notes are now automatically generated and published to GitHub Releases. These manual release note files are no longer needed in the root directory but are preserved here for historical reference.
