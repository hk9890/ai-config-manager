Add Resilient API Client\n```go\n// pkg/source/agentskills/client.go\ntype Client struct {\n    BaseURL string\n    Timeout time.Duration\n}\n\nfunc (c *Client) ResolveSkill(owner, name string) (*SkillInfo, error) {\n    // Try API first\n    info, err := c.fetchFromAPI(owner, name)\n    if err != nil {\n        // Fallback to GitHub convention\n        return c.resolveViaGitHub(owner, name)\n    }\n    return info, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Parse `as:` Prefix\n```go\n// pkg/source/parser.go\nif strings.HasPrefix(input, \"as:\") {\n    return parseAgentSkillsPrefix(input)\n}\n\nfunc parseAgentSkillsPrefix(input string) (*ParsedSource, error) {\n    // Parse: as:@anthropic/xlsx\n    // Use API client to resolve\n    // Convert to GitHub URL if API fails\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Graceful Degradation\n```\nUser: aimgr repo import as:@anthropic/xlsx\n  ↓\nTry: API lookup (agentskills.in/api/skills)\n  ↓ (if fails)\nFallback: GitHub convention (gh:anthropic/skills)\n  ↓\nImport skill\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Can import via `gh:owner/repo` (works today)\n- [ ] Can import via `as:@owner/skill` (new feature)\n- [ ] API client handles HTTP 500 gracefully\n- [ ] Falls back to GitHub if API unavailable\n- [ ] Error messages guide users to working alternatives\n- [ ] Documented: When to use `gh:` vs `as:` prefix\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Document existing Git support** - Show users `gh:` works now\n2. **Design API client** - Resilient, with fallback\n3. **Wait for API stability** - Or contact AgentSkills team\n4. **Implement `as:` prefix** - When API is reliable\n\n## References\n\n- Research: `docs/research/source-provider-architecture.md`\n- Investigation: ai-config-manager-dgh\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hans.kohlreiter@dynatrace.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T20:33:45.827232234+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter","updated_at":"2026-02-11T19:09:38.413358641+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T19:09:38.413358641+01:00","close_reason":"AgentSkills.in is Git-based, not API-based.

{"id":"ai-config-manager-p0w","title":"Document AgentSkills.in support via GitHub sources","description":"## Description\n\nDocument that AgentSkills.in is already supported via our existing GitHub source integration. Users can import skills from AgentSkills by using the `gh:` prefix.\n\n## Context\n\nResearch confirmed that AgentSkills.in is a **directory/marketplace of GitHub repositories**, not a centralized package registry with an API. All skills are distributed via GitHub repos.\n\n## Implementation\n\nCreate user documentation showing how to work with AgentSkills resources.\n\n### Files to Create/Update\n\n1. **Create**: `docs/user-guide/agentskills-support.md`\n   \n   **Content**:\n   ```markdown\n   # Working with AgentSkills.in\n   \n   ## Overview\n   \n   [AgentSkills.in](https://agentskills.in) is a marketplace that indexes AI agent skills from GitHub repositories. All skills are distributed via GitHub, which means **aimgr already supports AgentSkills** through our existing GitHub integration.\n   \n   ## How AgentSkills Works\n   \n   - AgentSkills.in provides a web directory for browsing skills\n   - Each skill is stored in a GitHub repository\n   - The `@owner/skillname` format maps to GitHub repos\n   \n   ## Importing AgentSkills Resources\n   \n   ### Method 1: Import Entire Repository\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Find the GitHub repo on agentskills.in\n   # Then import using gh: prefix\n   aimgr repo import gh:anthropic/skills\n   ```\n   \n   ### Method 2: Import Specific Skill with Filter\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Import only specific skill(s)\n   aimgr repo import gh:anthropic/skills --filter \"skill/xlsx\"\n   aimgr repo import gh:vercel-labs/agent-skills --filter \"skill/pdf*\"\n   ```\n   \n   ### Method 3: Import and Install\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Import to repository\n   aimgr repo import gh:anthropic/skills\n   \n   # Install specific skill to project\n   cd my-project\n   aimgr install skill/xlsx --tool=claude\n   ```\n   \n   ## Finding GitHub Repositories\n   \n   To find the GitHub URL for an AgentSkills resource:\n   \n   1. Visit [agentskills.in/marketplace](https://agentskills.in/marketplace)\n   2. Search for the skill you want\n   3. Click on the skill to view details\n   4. Note the GitHub owner/repo information\n   5. Use: `aimgr repo import gh:owner/repo`\n   \n   ## Common AgentSkills Repositories\n   \n   | Repository | Description |\n   |------------|-------------|\n   | `gh:anthropic/skills` | Official Anthropic skills |\n   | `gh:vercel-labs/agent-skills` | Vercel AI skills |\n   | `gh:Karanjot786/agent-skills-cli` | AgentSkills CLI examples |\n   \n   ## Syncing AgentSkills Sources\n   \n   Add to your sync configuration:\n   \n   ```yaml\n   # ~/.config/aimgr/aimgr.yaml\n   sync:\n     sources:\n       - url: gh:anthropic/skills\n         filter: \"skill/*\"\n       \n       - url: gh:vercel-labs/agent-skills\n         filter: \"skill/pdf*\"\n   ```\n   \n   Then sync:\n   \n   ```bash\n   aimgr repo sync\n   ```\n   \n   ## Why No Special Integration?\n   \n   AgentSkills.in has no programmatic API - it's purely a web directory that links to GitHub repositories. Since aimgr already has robust GitHub integration with:\n   \n   - ✅ `gh:` prefix support\n   - ✅ Workspace caching (10-50x faster)\n   - ✅ Metadata tracking\n   - ✅ Filtering and pattern matching\n   \n   No special AgentSkills integration is needed.\n   \n   ## See Also\n   \n   - [GitHub Sources](./github-sources.md)\n   - [Pattern Matching](./pattern-matching.md)\n   - [Sync Sources](./sync-sources.md)\n   ```\n\n2. **Update**: `README.md` - Add AgentSkills section\n\n   Add to the \"Supported Sources\" section:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   ### AgentSkills.in\n   \n   [AgentSkills.in](https://agentskills.in) resources are supported through GitHub integration:\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Import from AgentSkills marketplace\n   aimgr repo import gh:anthropic/skills --filter \"skill/xlsx\"\n   ```\n   \n   See [docs/user-guide/agentskills-support.md](docs/user-guide/agentskills-support.md) for details.\n   ```\n\n3. **Update**: `docs/user-guide/github-sources.md`\n\n   Add note at the top:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   \u003e **Note**: [AgentSkills.in](https://agentskills.in) resources are distributed via GitHub.\n   \u003e See [agentskills-support.md](./agentskills-support.md) for AgentSkills-specific guidance.\n   ```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] New file created: `docs/user-guide/agentskills-support.md`\n- [ ] README.md updated with AgentSkills mention\n- [ ] `docs/user-guide/github-sources.md` updated with cross-reference\n- [ ] Documentation tested with actual AgentSkills examples\n- [ ] Links verified (agentskills.in, GitHub repos)\n\n## References\n\n- Research: `docs/research/source-provider-architecture.md` (lines 936-1103)\n- Research: `docs/research/competitor-analysis-agent-skills-cli.md`\n- Epic closure: ai-config-manager-660\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hans.kohlreiter@dynatrace.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T19:10:07.609062476+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter","updated_at":"2026-02-11T19:10:07.609062476+01:00"}
