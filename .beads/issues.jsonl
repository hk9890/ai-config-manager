Users can import skills from AgentSkills by using the `gh:` prefix.\n\n## Context\n\nResearch confirmed that AgentSkills.in is a **directory/marketplace of GitHub repositories**, not a centralized package registry with an API. All skills are distributed via GitHub repos.\n\n## Implementation\n\nCreate user documentation showing how to work with AgentSkills resources.\n\n### Files to Create/Update\n\n1. **Create**: `docs/user-guide/agentskills-support.md`\n   \n   **Content**:\n   ```markdown\n   # Working with AgentSkills.in\n   \n   ## Overview\n   \n   [AgentSkills.in](https://agentskills.in) is a marketplace that indexes AI agent skills from GitHub repositories. All skills are distributed via GitHub, which means **aimgr already supports AgentSkills** through our existing GitHub integration.\n   \n   ## How AgentSkills Works\n   \n   - AgentSkills.in provides a web directory for browsing skills\n   - Each skill is stored in a GitHub repository\n   - The `@owner/skillname` format maps to GitHub repos\n   \n   ## Importing AgentSkills Resources\n   \n   ### Method 1: Import Entire Repository\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Find the GitHub repo on agentskills.in\n   # Then import using gh: prefix\n   aimgr repo import gh:anthropic/skills\n   ```\n   \n   ### Method 2: Import Specific Skill with Filter\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Import only specific skill(s)\n   aimgr repo import gh:anthropic/skills --filter \"skill/xlsx\"\n   aimgr repo import gh:vercel-labs/agent-skills --filter \"skill/pdf*\"\n   ```\n   \n   ### Method 3: Import and Install\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Import to repository\n   aimgr repo import gh:anthropic/skills\n   \n   # Install specific skill to project\n   cd my-project\n   aimgr install skill/xlsx --tool=claude\n   ```\n   \n   ## Finding GitHub Repositories\n   \n   To find the GitHub URL for an AgentSkills resource:\n   \n   1. Visit [agentskills.in/marketplace](https://agentskills.in/marketplace)\n   2. Search for the skill you want\n   3. Click on the skill to view details\n   4.

Since aimgr already has robust GitHub integration with:\n   \n   - ✅ `gh:` prefix support\n   - ✅ Workspace caching (10-50x faster)\n   - ✅ Metadata tracking\n   - ✅ Filtering and pattern matching\n   \n   No special AgentSkills integration is needed.\n   \n   ## See Also\n   \n   - [GitHub Sources](./github-sources.md)\n   - [Pattern Matching](./pattern-matching.md)\n   - [Sync Sources](./sync-sources.md)\n   ```\n\n2. **Update**: `README.md` - Add AgentSkills section\n\n   Add to the \"Supported Sources\" section:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   ### AgentSkills.in\n   \n   [AgentSkills.in](https://agentskills.in) resources are supported through GitHub integration:\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Import from AgentSkills marketplace\n   aimgr repo import gh:anthropic/skills --filter \"skill/xlsx\"\n   ```\n   \n   See [docs/user-guide/agentskills-support.md](docs/user-guide/agentskills-support.md) for details.\n   ```\n\n3. **Update**: `docs/user-guide/github-sources.md`\n\n   Add note at the top:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   \u003e **Note**: [AgentSkills.in](https://agentskills.in) resources are distributed via GitHub.\n   \u003e See [agentskills-support.md](./agentskills-support.md) for AgentSkills-specific guidance.\n   ```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] New file created: `docs/user-guide/agentskills-support.md`\n- [ ] README.md updated with AgentSkills mention\n- [ ] `docs/user-guide/github-sources.md` updated with cross-reference\n- [ ] Documentation tested with actual AgentSkills examples\n- [ ] Links verified (agentskills.in, GitHub repos)\n\n## References\n\n- Research: `docs/research/source-provider-architecture.md` (lines 936-1103)\n- Research: `docs/research/competitor-analysis-agent-skills-cli.md`\n- Epic closure: ai-config-manager-660\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hans.kohlreiter@dynatrace.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T19:10:07.609062476+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter","updated_at":"2026-02-11T19:28:05.347000939+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T19:28:05.347000939+01:00","close_reason":"User decision: Cancel AgentSkills integration.

Discovery Command**: `aimgr search agentskills \u003cquery\u003e`\n```bash\n# Search all 175k+ skills\naimgr search agentskills \"pdf processing\"\n\n# Browse by category\naimgr search agentskills --category=ai-development\n\n# Find by author\naimgr search agentskills --author=anthropic\n\n# Sort by popularity\naimgr search agentskills \"react\" --sort=stars\n```\n\n**2. Convenient Import**: `aimgr repo import as:@author/skill`\n```bash\n# Resolve via API, import from GitHub\naimgr repo import as:@facebook/test\n\n# Workflow:\n# 1. API lookup: GET /api/skills?author=facebook\u0026search=test\n# 2. Extract githubUrl and repoFullName\n# 3. Import: gh:facebook/react --filter \".claude/skills/test\"\n```\n\n**3. Interactive Browse**\n```bash\naimgr browse agentskills\n# Shows paginated list with descriptions\n# Arrow keys to navigate, Enter to import\n```\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: API Client (Week 1)\n\n**Create**: `pkg/source/agentskills/client.go`\n\n```go\npackage agentskills\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"net/url\"\n)\n\nconst BaseURL = \"https://www.agentskills.in/api\"\n\ntype Skill struct {\n    ID            string `json:\"id\"`\n    Name          string `json:\"name\"`\n    Description   string `json:\"description\"`\n    Author        string `json:\"author\"`\n    Stars         int    `json:\"stars\"`\n    Forks         int    `json:\"forks\"`\n    GitHubURL     string `json:\"githubUrl\"`\n    ScopedName    string `json:\"scopedName\"`\n    AuthorAvatar  string `json:\"authorAvatar\"`\n    RepoFullName  string `json:\"repoFullName\"`\n    Path          string `json:\"path\"`\n    Category      string `json:\"category\"`\n    HasContent    bool   `json:\"hasContent\"`\n}\n\ntype SearchOptions struct {\n    Query    string\n    Author   string\n    Category string\n    SortBy   string // \"stars\", \"recent\"\n    Limit    int\n    Offset   int\n}\n\ntype Client struct {\n    BaseURL    string\n    HTTPClient *http.Client\n}\n\nfunc NewClient() *Client {\n    return \u0026Client{\n        BaseURL:    BaseURL,\n        HTTPClient: \u0026http.Client{Timeout: 10 * time.Second},\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (c *Client) Search(opts SearchOptions) ([]Skill, int, error) {\n    params := url.Values{}\n    if opts.Query != \"\" {\n        params.Set(\"search\", opts.Query)\n    }\n    if opts.Author != \"\" {\n        params.Set(\"author\", opts.Author)\n    }\n    if opts.Category != \"\" {\n        params.Set(\"category\", opts.Category)\n    }\n    if opts.SortBy != \"\" {\n        params.Set(\"sortBy\", opts.SortBy)\n    }\n    if opts.Limit \u003e 0 {\n        params.Set(\"limit\", fmt.Sprintf(\"%d\", opts.Limit))\n    }\n    if opts.Offset \u003e 0 {\n        params.Set(\"offset\", fmt.Sprintf(\"%d\", opts.Offset))\n    }\n\n    url := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s/skills?%s\", c.BaseURL, params.Encode())\n    resp, err := c.HTTPClient.Get(url)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, 0, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to query API: %w\", err)\n    }\n    defer resp.Body.Close()\n\n    if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {\n        return nil, 0, fmt.Errorf(\"API returned status %d\", resp.StatusCode)\n    }\n\n    var result struct {\n        Skills []Skill `json:\"skills\"`\n        Total  int     `json:\"total\"`\n    }\n\n    if err := json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(\u0026result);
