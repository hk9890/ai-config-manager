Create Release Documentation\n\nCreate `docs/RELEASE.md`:\n\n```markdown\n# Release Process\n\n## Creating a New Release\n\n1. **Update version** in code if needed\n2. **Commit all changes**\n3. **Create and push tag**:\n   ```bash\n   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m \"Release v0.1.0\"\n   git push origin v0.1.0\n   ```\n4. **GitHub Actions automatically**:\n   - Builds binaries for all platforms\n   - Creates GitHub Release\n   - Uploads binaries and checksums\n   - Generates changelog\n\n## Version Numbering\n\nFollow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):\n- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes\n- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)\n- **PATCH**: Bug fixes\n\n## Testing Releases Locally\n\n```bash\n# Test GoReleaser without publishing\ngoreleaser release --snapshot --clean\n\n# Check generated artifacts\nls dist/\n```\n```\n\n## Files to Create\n\n- `.goreleaser.yaml`\n- `.github/workflows/build.yml`\n- `.github/workflows/release.yml`\n- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` (optional)\n- `docs/RELEASE.md`\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `.gitignore` (add bin/, dist/)\n- `README.md` (add installation section)\n- `pkg/version/version.go` (ensure ldflags path matches)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `.goreleaser.yaml` created and configured\n- [ ] Build workflow runs on push/PR\n- [ ] Release workflow triggers on version tags\n- [ ] Test workflow passes\n- [ ] Version injection works (ldflags paths correct)\n- [ ] README has installation instructions\n- [ ] Release documentation created\n- [ ] .gitignore updated\n\n## Testing the Setup\n\n1. Push changes to trigger build workflow\n2. Verify all platform builds succeed\n3. Create test tag: `git tag v0.1.0-test \u0026\u0026 git push origin v0.1.0-test`\n4. Verify release workflow creates GitHub Release\n5. Download and test binaries from release\n\n## Notes\n\n- GoReleaser requires GitHub token (automatically provided by GitHub Actions)\n- First release may need manual configuration on GitHub repo settings\n- Update `YOUR_USERNAME` placeholders with actual GitHub username\n- Ensure `main` is the default branch (or update workflow triggers)\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hans.kohlreiter@dynatrace.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T20:44:53.632918742+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter","updated_at":"2026-01-18T20:52:44.952587756+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-18T20:52:44.952587756+01:00","close_reason":"Implemented GitHub Actions and release process with GoReleaser.

Create `pkg/source/git_test.go`:\n   - Test cloning public repo\n   - Test cloning with specific branch\n   - Test cleanup validation (security)\n   - Test error handling (invalid repo, network issues)\n   - Mock git commands for tests (or use test fixtures)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires git to be installed on system\n- May need to add git availability check\n\n## Files to Create\n- pkg/source/git.go\n- pkg/source/git_test.go\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Successfully clones public repositories\n- [ ] Handles branch/tag references\n- [ ] Creates temp directory in appropriate location\n- [ ] Cleanup validates path safety (no arbitrary deletions)\n- [ ] Graceful error messages for common issues\n- [ ] Tests pass\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hans.kohlreiter@dynatrace.com","created_at":"2026-01-21T20:06:27.541512027+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter","updated_at":"2026-01-21T20:35:44.868533952+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-21T20:35:44.868533952+01:00","close_reason":"Implemented Git cloning functionality with CloneRepo and CleanupTempDir functions.
