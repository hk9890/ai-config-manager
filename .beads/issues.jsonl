Failure to remove these will cause:\n- Double-truncation (text truncated twice)\n- Responsive sizing ignored (40/60 char limits prevent dynamic growth)\n- Inconsistent behavior across terminal widths\n\n## Instructions\nFor each table usage identified in audit:\n\n1. **Add responsive configuration:**\n   ```go\n   table := output.NewTable(headers...)\n   table.WithResponsive().\n         WithDynamicColumn(lastColumnIndex)\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove hardcoded truncateString() calls** (see NOTES for complete list):\n   -

responsive sizing handles truncation\ntable.AddRow(resourceRef, targets, syncSymbol, cmd.Description)\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Migration Instructions\n\nFor EACH table location:\n\n1. **Add responsive configuration:**\n   ```go\n   table := output.NewTable(headers...)\n   table.WithResponsive().\n         WithDynamicColumn(lastColumnIndex)\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove truncateString() calls:**\n   - Delete the `desc := truncateString(...)` line\n   - Pass the full description field directly to `table.AddRow()`\n\n3. **Example for cmd/list_installed.go (commands section):**\n   ```go\n   // BEFORE\n   for _, cmd := range commands {\n       desc := truncateString(cmd.Description, 40)  // ← Delete this line\n       targets := strings.Join(cmd.Targets, \", \")\n       resourceRef := fmt.Sprintf(\"command/%s\", cmd.Name)\n       syncSymbol := formatSyncStatus(projectPath, resourceRef, len(cmd.Targets) \u003e 0)\n       table.AddRow(resourceRef, targets, syncSymbol, desc)  // ← Change desc to cmd.Description\n   }\n   \n   // AFTER\n   for _, cmd := range commands {\n       targets := strings.Join(cmd.Targets, \", \")\n       resourceRef := fmt.Sprintf(\"command/%s\", cmd.Name)\n       syncSymbol := formatSyncStatus(projectPath, resourceRef, len(cmd.Targets) \u003e 0)\n       table.AddRow(resourceRef, targets, syncSymbol, cmd.Description)  // ← Full description\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Repeat for skills and agents sections** in same file\n\n5. **Repeat pattern for each file** (list.go, repo_import.go)\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\nAfter removing truncation, verify:\n\n1. **Wide terminal (120+ columns):**\n   - Descriptions show MORE than 40/60 characters\n   - No artificial truncation at 40 or 60 chars\n   - Text uses available space\n\n2. **Narrow terminal (80 columns):**\n   - Descriptions truncate dynamically with \"...\"\n   - Truncation point varies based on other column widths\n   - No double-truncation (no \"...\" in middle of text)\n\n3. **Very narrow terminal (60 columns):**\n   - Last column still visible\n   - Graceful truncation\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n**Double-truncation problem:**\n```\nOriginal: \"This is a very long description that needs to be shown\"\nAfter hardcoded truncate(40): \"This is a very long description that n...\"\nAfter responsive truncate(80): \"This is a very long description that n...\" (wasted space!)\n```\n\n**Correct behavior (no hardcoded truncation):**\n```\nOriginal: \"This is a very long description that needs to be shown\"\nTerminal width 120, available 80: \"This is a very long description that needs to be shown\"\nTerminal width 80, available 40: \"This is a very long description that...\"\n```\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Additions\n\n- [ ] All 9 truncateString() calls removed from Description columns\n- [ ] Full descriptions passed to table.AddRow() \n- [ ] Manual testing confirms NO 40-char or 60-char limits remain\n- [ ] Wide terminals show significantly more text than before\n- [ ] Truncation is dynamic based on terminal width, not hardcoded\n\n### Total Changes Required\n\n- **3 files** to modify\n- **9 truncateString() calls** to remove\n- **4 functions** to update:\n  -

Use the v1.1.3 API documented in research task ai-config-manager-pjy.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Add configuration to TableOptions:\n   - DynamicColumn int (index of column to stretch)\n   - MinColumnWidths []int (minimum width for each column before hiding)\n   - TruncationChar string (default \"...\")\n2. Enhance TableBuilder with methods:\n   - WithDynamicColumn(index int) - mark column to fill remaining space\n   - WithMinColumnWidths(widths ...int) - set minimum widths\n3. Update renderTable() function to:\n   - Calculate available terminal width\n   - Allocate fixed widths to static columns\n   - Assign remaining width to dynamic column\n   - Truncate text with \"...\" when exceeding column width\n   - Hide columns that can't fit minimum width (right to left priority)\n   - Ensure full terminal width is used\n4.

No Git clone needed.\n\n## Research Questions\n\n1. **Does agentskills.in need workspace caching?**\n   - API returns full content in response\n   - No need to clone Git repos\n   - But: API calls have latency, could we cache responses?\n\n2. **If we cache, what do we cache?**\n   - Option A: Cache API responses (JSON) for 5 minutes\n   - Option B: Store downloaded skills in workspace-like directory\n   - Option C: No caching, always fetch fresh from API\n\n3. **How would workspace be used?**\n   - GitHub: `workspace/github.com-owner-repo-ref/`\n   - agentskills: `workspace/agentskills-\u003cskill-id\u003e/`?\n   - Or: No workspace at all?\n\n4. **What's the update flow?**\n   - GitHub: `git pull` in cached repo\n   - agentskills: Re-fetch from API (always fresh)\n   - Do we need to cache for `aimgr repo sync` performance?\n\n5. **Comparison with GitHub source:**\n   ```\n   GitHub source:\n     1.

{"id":"ai-config-manager-aiv","title":"Document non-TTY and piped output behavior","description":"## Description\nEpic doesn't address how responsive tables should behave when output is piped or redirected (non-TTY contexts). This needs explicit documentation and testing.\n\n## Current Behavior\nCode has TTY detection:\n```go\nif data.Options.Responsive \u0026\u0026 IsTTY() {\n    // responsive sizing only when TTY\n}\n```\n\nBut it's unclear:\n1. What width should non-TTY tables use?\n2. Should JSON/YAML formats be affected by responsive settings?\n3. How should scripts consuming output be handled?\n\n## Questions to Answer\n\n### 1. Non-TTY Width Default\nWhen piped or redirected, what width should tables use?\n- **Option A**: 80 columns (safe default for most terminals)\n- **Option B**: 120 columns (wider, modern default)\n- **Option C**: Unlimited width (no truncation)\n- **Option D**: Disable responsive mode entirely (use original behavior)\n\n**Recommendation**: Option D (disable responsive when not TTY) - predictable output for scripts\n\n### 2. JSON/YAML Format Isolation\nShould responsive settings affect structured output?\n```bash\naimgr list --format=json   # Should be identical regardless of terminal width\naimgr list --format=yaml   # Should be identical regardless of terminal width\naimgr list --format=table  # Responsive sizing applies\n```\n\n**Expected**: Responsive settings should ONLY affect `--format=table`, never JSON/YAML\n\n### 3. Piped Output Scenarios\nHow should these behave?\n```bash\naimgr list | less           # Not TTY - disable responsive?\naimgr list | grep \"skill\"   # Not TTY - fixed width?\naimgr list \u003e output.txt     # Not TTY - fixed width?\n```\n\n**Expected**: Non-TTY contexts get fixed-width tables (80 or 120 cols)\n\n### 4. CI/Automation Environments\nIn CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, etc.):\n- No TTY available\n- Output may be logged/displayed in various widths\n- Need consistent, predictable output\n\n**Expected**: Disable responsive mode in CI environments\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n1. **Update renderTable() logic**:\n   ```go\n   if data.Options.Responsive \u0026\u0026 IsTTY() {\n       // responsive sizing\n   } else {\n       // fixed width (80 or 120 cols)\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify JSON/YAML isolation**:\n   - formatTableData() should skip responsive logic for JSON/YAML\n   - Only renderTable() handles responsive sizing\n\n3. **Add tests**:\n   - Test table rendering with IsTTY() = false\n   - Verify JSON/YAML output identical at all terminal widths\n   - Test piped output scenarios\n\n4. **Document behavior**:\n   - User guide explaining TTY vs non-TTY behavior\n   - Mention in help text if relevant\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Non-TTY default width chosen and documented (recommend: fixed 80 cols)\n- [ ] Responsive mode explicitly disabled when !IsTTY()\n- [ ] JSON/YAML formats verified unaffected by terminal width\n- [ ] Tests added for non-TTY scenarios\n- [ ] Documentation updated with TTY vs non-TTY behavior\n- [ ] Gate criteria updated to test piped output\n\n## Example Test\n```go\nfunc TestTableBuilder_NonTTY_FixedWidth(t *testing.T) {\n    // Simulate non-TTY environment\n    // Table should use fixed width regardless of Options.Responsive\n    table := NewTable(\"Name\", \"Description\").WithResponsive()\n    table.AddRow(\"test\", \"A very long description...\")\n    \n    // Verify output uses fixed width (not terminal width)\n    output := captureTableOutput(table)\n    // Assert width is fixed (80 or 120)\n}\n```\n\n## Priority\nMedium - Important for production use but doesn't block initial implementation\n\n## Dependencies\n- Related to: ai-config-manager-6ju (implementation should consider this)\n- Related to: ai-config-manager-815 (tests should cover non-TTY)\n","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hans.kohlreiter@dynatrace.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T11:15:45.854000114+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter","updated_at":"2026-02-13T11:21:38.088050001+01:00"}

Need to determine:\n1. Does `NewWriter()` support both old and new methods in v1.1.3?\n2. Or is this a transitional compatibility layer?\n3. Should all code migrate to `NewTable()` constructor?\n\n## Impact on Responsive Tables\n- If migrating to full v1.1.3 API (`NewTable()` with options), formatter.go is already closer to target\n- table.go needs bigger changes\n- Audit found formatter.go won't automatically benefit from responsive sizing\n\n## Recommendation\nAs part of responsive table work:\n1. **Standardize on v1.1.3 API**: Use `NewTable(os.Stdout, options...)` everywhere\n2. **Migrate table.go**: Change `NewWriter()` to `NewTable()` with options\n3. **Keep formatter.go consistent**: Ensure it also uses responsive options\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Investigate v1.1.3 API compatibility with NewWriter()\n- [ ] Document which API pattern should be used project-wide\n- [ ] Decide if this should be fixed as part of responsive table work or separately\n- [ ] Update implementation task if formatter.go needs migration too\n\n## Priority\nMedium - Should be resolved before or during implementation task\n\n## Dependencies\n- Related to: ai-config-manager-6ju (implementation task)\n- Related to: ai-config-manager-767 (API version confusion bug)\n","notes":"## Investigation Complete\n\n### Findings\n\n**API Inconsistency Confirmed**: The codebase uses two different patterns for the tablewriter v1.1.3 `Append()` method:\n\n1. **table.go (line 114)**: Uses slice-based API\n   ```go\n   table.Append(row)  // row is []string\n   ```\n\n2. **formatter.go (lines 206, 219, 232, 245)**: Uses variadic API with error checking\n   ```go\n   if err := table.Append(col1, col2, col3); err != nil {\n       return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to append row: %w\", err)\n   }\n   ```\n\n### API Compatibility\n\nBoth patterns work in v1.1.3 due to backward compatibility:\n- `Append(rows ...interface{})` accepts both `[]string` and individual string arguments\n- The variadic signature allows: `Append(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")` OR `Append([]string{\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"})`\n\n### Impact Assessment\n\n**Current Impact**: NONE\n- Code compiles successfully\n- All tests pass (except unrelated nested commands test)\n- Both patterns produce identical output\n\n**Future Impact**: MINIMAL\n- Inconsistency creates confusion for developers\n- Error handling is inconsistent (formatter checks errors, table.go doesn't)\n- Code is less maintainable\n\n### Recommendation\n\n**NOT CRITICAL** - This can be fixed during the responsive table implementation (ai-config-manager-6ju):\n\n1. Standardize on variadic API: `table.Append(col1, col2, col3)`\n2. Add error checking consistently\n3.

{"id":"ai-config-manager-bjn","title":"Migrate all table rendering to shared pkg/output infrastructure","description":"## Description\nConsolidate all table rendering code to use the shared `pkg/output/TableBuilder` infrastructure. Currently, commands bypass this and use `tablewriter.NewWriter()` directly, which prevents implementing global table features like reactive resizing.\n\n## Current State\nCommands using direct tablewriter (bypassing shared infra):\n- `cmd/list.go` (repo list)\n- `cmd/list_installed.go` (list)\n- `cmd/repo_import.go` (import)\n\nShared infrastructure (underutilized):\n- `pkg/output/table.go` - TableBuilder with fluent API\n- `pkg/output/types.go` - TableOptions\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Audit all table usage\nFind all places using `tablewriter.NewWriter()` directly:\n```bash\nrg \"tablewriter\\.NewWriter\" cmd/\n```\n\nDocument each table's requirements:\n- Column headers\n- Data sources\n- Format support (table/json/yaml)\n- Special features (separators, grouping, etc.)\n\n### Step 2: Enhance TableBuilder if needed\nReview each table's needs and extend `pkg/output/TableBuilder` to support:\n- Column grouping/separators (already has `AddSeparator()`)\n- Custom column widths\n- Footer rows (for legends)\n- Any other patterns currently used\n\n### Step 3: Migrate commands one by one\nFor each command:\n\n1. Replace direct tablewriter with TableBuilder:\n```go\n// Before:\ntable := tablewriter.NewWriter(os.Stdout)\ntable.Header(\"Name\", \"Description\")\ntable.Append(name, desc)\ntable.Render()\n\n// After:\nerr := output.NewTable(\"Name\", \"Description\").\n    AddRow(name, desc).\n    Format(output.ParseFormat(formatFlag))\n```\n\n2.

Currently, tables don't utilize full screen width and lack smart column handling when space is limited.\n\n## Goals\n1. Tables should use the full terminal width available\n2. One column (typically last) should be dynamically sized to fill remaining space\n3. Text should be truncated with \"...\" when it doesn't fit\n4. Columns should be removed entirely if insufficient space is available\n5. All table usages in the project should benefit from this enhancement\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] All tables use full terminal width\n- [ ] Dynamic column sizing works correctly\n- [ ] Text truncation with \"...\" works when needed\n- [ ] Columns gracefully hide when space is too limited\n- [ ] All existing table usages are migrated\n- [ ] Tests verify the responsive behavior\n- [ ] Acceptance gate passed\n\n## Current State\n- Basic responsive table infrastructure exists (terminal size detection, TTY checks)\n- Tables use tablewriter library which has auto-wrap support\n- Tables found in: cmd/list.go, cmd/list_installed.go, cmd/repo_import.go, cmd/repo_verify.go\n- TableBuilder API is in place with WithResponsive() method\n\n## Technical Context\n- Terminal size detection: pkg/output/terminal.go\n- Table rendering: pkg/output/table.go (renderTable function)\n- Library: github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"hans.kohlreiter@dynatrace.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T10:38:58.811005405+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter","updated_at":"2026-02-13T10:38:58.811005405+01:00","labels":["need:review"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ai-config-manager-ea7","depends_on_id":"ai-config-manager-4cl","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T10:40:07.465545196+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter"}],"comments":[{"id":6,"issue_id":"ai-config-manager-ea7","author":"Hans Kohlreiter","text":"## Review Complete - NEEDS WORK\n\n**Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM\n**Status**: NEEDS WORK - 6 issues identified, 7 new beads created\n\n### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Implementation)\n1. **API Version Confusion** (Bug ai-config-manager-767): Implementation task references v0.0.5 API but project uses v1.1.3 - will cause compilation errors\n2. **Column Hiding Not Specified** (Task ai-config-manager-4fc): Requirements say \"hide columns when insufficient space\" but priority order and behavior undefined\n3. **Testing Strategy Missing** (Task ai-config-manager-7et): Tests propose mocking terminal width but no injection mechanism exists\n\n### Important Issues (Should Address)\n4. **Hardcoded Truncation** (Task ai-config-manager-qjn): Migration must remove existing truncateString() calls to avoid double-truncation\n5. **Non-TTY Behavior** (Task ai-config-manager-aiv): Piped/redirected output behavior not specified or tested\n6. **API Inconsistency** (Bug ai-config-manager-ar0): Codebase mixes legacy and modern tablewriter APIs\n\n### Documentation\n7. **Terminal Resize Limitation** (Task ai-config-manager-4kh): Document that tables don't reflow on terminal resize\n\n### Technical Soundness\n✅ tablewriter v1.1.3 approach is solid\n✅ Research and audit tasks excellent\n✅ WithMaxWidth, WithColumnWidths, WithRowAutoWrap(WrapTruncate) correct methods\n⚠️ Implementation task instructions reference wrong API version\n⚠️ Dual rendering paths (table.go vs formatter.go) add complexity\n\n### Completeness\n✅ Task breakdown logical\n✅ Dependencies correct\n⚠️ Edge cases need more specification\n⚠️ Error handling not explicitly planned\n⚠️ Performance testing not mentioned\n\n### Recommendation\nFix critical issues (especially API bug) before implementation starts.

The library provides extensive width control, wrapping, and truncation capabilities.\n\n## Key API Methods for Responsive Column Sizing\n\n### 1. Width Control Methods\n\n#### Global Width Control:\n- `WithMaxWidth(width int)` - Sets maximum total table width\n- `WithColumnMax(width int)` - Sets global maximum column width (for all columns)\n\n#### Per-Column Width Control:\n- `WithColumnWidths(widths tw.Mapper[int, int])` - Sets specific width for each column\n  - Example: `WithColumnWidths(map[int]int{0: 20, 1: 40, 2: 15})`\n- `WithWidths(width tw.CellWidth)` - More comprehensive width config including Global and PerColumn\n\n#### Section-Specific Width Control:\n- `WithHeaderMaxWidth(maxWidth int)` - Max width for header cells\n- `WithRowMaxWidth(maxWidth int)` - Max width for row cells  \n- `WithFooterMaxWidth(maxWidth int)` - Max width for footer cells\n\n### 2. Text Wrapping/Truncation Control\n\nThe library provides 4 wrapping modes via `tw.Wrap*` constants:\n\n```go\nconst (\n    WrapNone     = iota // No wrapping - text continues (may overflow)\n    WrapNormal          // Standard word wrapping at spaces\n    WrapTruncate        // Truncate text with ellipsis (...)\n    WrapBreak           // Break words to fit (hard wrap)\n)\n```\n\n#### Setting Wrap Modes:\n- `WithHeaderAutoWrap(wrap int)` - Wrapping for headers\n- `WithRowAutoWrap(wrap int)` - Wrapping for row cells\n- `WithFooterAutoWrap(wrap int)` - Wrapping for footers\n\n### 3. Column Hiding/Showing\n\n- `WithAutoHide(state tw.State)` - Automatically hide columns with all empty cells\n  - Use `tw.On` to enable, `tw.Off` to disable\n\n### 4. Terminal Width Detection\n\nThe project already has terminal width detection in `pkg/output/terminal.go`:\n- `NewTerminal()` - Gets current terminal dimensions\n- `IsTTY()` - Checks if output is a terminal\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n### Recommended Strategy for Responsive Tables:\n\n```go\n// 1. Detect terminal width\nterm, err := NewTerminal()\ntermWidth := 80 // default\nif err == nil \u0026\u0026 term.Width() \u003e 0 {\n    termWidth = term.Width()\n}\n\n// 2. Calculate column widths dynamically\n// Reserve space for borders: 3 chars per column (| col |) + 1 for final border\nnumCols := len(headers)\nborderOverhead := (numCols * 3) + 1\n\n// Allocate space for fixed-width columns (e.g., Type, Status)\nfixedCols := map[int]int{\n    0: 20,  // Name column\n    2: 10,  // Status column\n}\n\n// Calculate remaining space for flexible column(s)\nusedSpace := borderOverhead\nfor _, w := range fixedCols {\n    usedSpace += w\n}\nflexibleSpace := termWidth - usedSpace\n\n// 3. Create table with width constraints\ntable := tablewriter.NewTable(os.Stdout,\n    tablewriter.WithMaxWidth(termWidth),\n    tablewriter.WithColumnWidths(map[int]int{\n        0: 20,                    // Fixed: Name\n        1: flexibleSpace,         // Flexible: Description (gets remaining space)\n        2: 10,                    // Fixed: Status\n    }),\n    tablewriter.WithRowAutoWrap(tw.WrapTruncate),  // Truncate with ...\n)\n```\n\n### Alternative: ConfigBuilder Approach\n\nFor more complex scenarios:\n\n```go\nbuilder := tablewriter.NewConfigBuilder()\nbuilder.WithMaxWidth(termWidth)\nbuilder.Row().Formatting().WithAutoWrap(tw.WrapTruncate)\nbuilder.ForColumn(0).WithWidth(20).Build()  // Name column\nbuilder.ForColumn(1).WithWidth(flexibleSpace).Build()  // Description\nbuilder.ForColumn(2).WithWidth(10).Build()  // Status\n\ntable := tablewriter.NewTable(os.Stdout, tablewriter.WithConfig(builder.Build()))\n```\n\n## Text Truncation with Ellipsis\n\nTo truncate text with \"...\", use:\n```go\ntablewriter.WithRowAutoWrap(tw.WrapTruncate)\n```\n\nThis will automatically add \"...\" when text exceeds the column width.\n\n## Column Visibility\n\nTo hide columns conditionally:\n1. Use `WithAutoHide(tw.On)` for automatic hiding of empty columns\n2. For manual control, filter data rows before adding to table\n3. Adjust `headers` and data slices to exclude unwanted columns\n\n## Limitations \u0026 Workarounds\n\n### Limitation 1: No Dynamic \"Stretch\" Column Built-in\n- **Issue**: Library doesn't have a built-in \"fill remaining space\" option for one column\n- **Workaround**: Calculate manually using terminal width minus fixed columns (see code above)\n\n### Limitation 2: WrapTruncate Behavior\n- **Issue**: Truncation happens at max width, not at visible width\n- **Workaround**: Set max width to desired truncation point minus 3 chars for \"...\"\n\n### Limitation 3: Multi-line Headers with Truncation\n- **Issue**: Truncation may not work well with multi-line wrapped headers\n- **Workaround**: Use `WithHeaderAutoWrap(tw.WrapNone)` or fixed header text\n\n### Limitation 4: Terminal Width Changes\n- **Issue**: Table width is set once at creation, doesn't respond to terminal resize\n- **Workaround**: Detect terminal width before each table render (current implementation)\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Example 1: Basic Responsive Table\n```go\nfunc renderResponsiveTable(data *TableData) error {\n    term, _ := NewTerminal()\n    termWidth := term.Width()\n    if termWidth == 0 {\n        termWidth = 80\n    }\n\n    table := tablewriter.NewTable(os.Stdout,\n        tablewriter.WithMaxWidth(termWidth),\n        tablewriter.WithRowAutoWrap(tw.WrapTruncate),\n    )\n    \n    table.Header(data.Headers)\n    table.Bulk(convertRows(data.Rows))\n    return table.Render()\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Fixed + Flexible Columns\n```go\nfunc renderTableWithFlexColumn(headers []string, rows [][]string) error {\n    term, _ := NewTerminal()\n    termWidth := term.Width()\n    \n    // Fixed widths for first and last columns\n    colWidths := calculateColumnWidths(termWidth, len(headers), \n        map[int]int{0: 20, 2: 10})\n    \n    table := tablewriter.NewTable(os.Stdout,\n        tablewriter.WithMaxWidth(termWidth),\n        tablewriter.WithColumnWidths(colWidths),\n        tablewriter.WithRowAutoWrap(tw.WrapTruncate),\n    )\n    \n    table.Header(headers)\n    for _, row := range rows {\n        table.Append(row...)\n    }\n    return table.Render()\n}\n\nfunc calculateColumnWidths(termWidth, numCols int, fixedCols map[int]int) map[int]int {\n    borderOverhead := (numCols * 3) + 1\n    usedSpace := borderOverhead\n    \n    for _, w := range fixedCols {\n        usedSpace += w\n    }\n    \n    flexibleWidth := (termWidth - usedSpace) / (numCols - len(fixedCols))\n    \n    result := make(map[int]int)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numCols; i++ {\n        if width, ok := fixedCols[i]; ok {\n            result[i] = width\n        } else {\n            result[i] = flexibleWidth\n        }\n    }\n    return result\n}\n```\n\n### Example 3: Hide Columns Based on Terminal Width\n```go\nfunc renderAdaptiveTable(allHeaders []string, allRows [][]string) error {\n    term, _ := NewTerminal()\n    termWidth := term.Width()\n    \n    // Prioritize columns: required -\u003e important -\u003e optional\n    columnsToShow := selectColumnsForWidth(termWidth, allHeaders)\n    \n    headers := filterColumns(allHeaders, columnsToShow)\n    rows := make([][]string, len(allRows))\n    for i, row := range allRows {\n        rows[i] = filterColumns(row, columnsToShow)\n    }\n    \n    table := tablewriter.NewTable(os.Stdout,\n        tablewriter.WithMaxWidth(termWidth),\n        tablewriter.WithRowAutoWrap(tw.WrapTruncate),\n    )\n    \n    table.Header(headers)\n    table.Bulk(rows)\n    return table.Render()\n}\n```\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nThe current implementation in `pkg/output/table.go` uses the legacy `NewWriter` approach but v1.1.3 is installed. Key changes needed:\n\n1. **Constructor**: Change from `tablewriter.NewWriter(os.Stdout)` to `tablewriter.NewTable(os.Stdout, options...)`\n2. **Headers**: Change from `table.SetHeader([]string)` to `table.Header(strings...)` or `table.Header([]string)`\n3. **Rows**: `table.Append(row)` works the same, or use `table.Bulk([][]any)`\n4. **Options**: Replace old `table.SetXxx()` calls with `WithXxx()` options in constructor\n\n## References\n\n- Library docs: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter@v1.1.3\n- Migration guide: /home/hans/go/pkg/mod/github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter@v1.1.3/MIGRATION.md\n- Wrap constants: /home/hans/go/pkg/mod/github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter@v1.1.3/tw/tw.go\n- Options: /home/hans/go/pkg/mod/github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter@v1.1.3/option.go","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hans.kohlreiter@dynatrace.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T10:39:06.13567252+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter","updated_at":"2026-02-13T11:08:07.319533309+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T11:08:07.319533309+01:00","close_reason":"Research complete.

{"id":"ai-config-manager-q7m","title":"Add responsive/reactive table support to pkg/output","description":"## Description\nAdd terminal-aware table rendering that automatically adapts column widths based on terminal size. Tables should detect terminal resizing and adjust layout dynamically.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThis task depends on all tables using the shared `pkg/output/TableBuilder` infrastructure (see ai-config-manager-bjn).\n\n## Research Phase\n\n### 1. Terminal size detection\nInvestigate Go packages for terminal dimensions:\n- `golang.org/x/term` - Standard terminal handling\n- `github.com/mattn/go-isatty` - TTY detection\n- `syscall` - Direct ioctl for TIOCGWINSZ\n\nExample:\n```go\nimport \"golang.org/x/term\"\n\nfunc getTerminalSize() (width, height int, err error) {\n    width, height, err = term.GetSize(int(os.Stdout.Fd()))\n    return\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Terminal resize detection\nResearch approaches for detecting SIGWINCH (window change signal):\n```go\nimport (\n    \"os\"\n    \"os/signal\"\n    \"syscall\"\n)\n\nfunc watchTerminalResize(callback func(width, height int)) {\n    sigwinch := make(chan os.Signal, 1)\n    signal.Notify(sigwinch, syscall.SIGWINCH)\n    \n    go func() {\n        for range sigwinch {\n            width, height, _ := getTerminalSize()\n            callback(width, height)\n        }\n    }()\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Column width strategy\nResearch how to distribute available width:\n- Fixed-width columns (e.g., \"SYNC\" = 6 chars)\n- Proportional columns (e.g., NAME = 30%, DESCRIPTION = 60%)\n- Minimum widths (prevent columns from becoming unreadable)\n- Priority-based truncation (truncate less important columns first)\n\n## Design Phase\n\n### 1. Extend TableOptions\nAdd responsive configuration to `pkg/output/types.go`:\n```go\ntype TableOptions struct {\n    ShowBorders  bool\n    AutoWrap     bool\n    Responsive   bool                    // Enable terminal-aware sizing\n    MinWidth     int                     // Minimum table width\n    ColumnWidths map[string]ColumnWidth  // Per-column configuration\n}\n\ntype ColumnWidth struct {\n    Fixed      int     // Fixed width (0 = not fixed)\n    MinWidth   int     // Minimum width for proportional columns\n    MaxWidth   int     // Maximum width (0 = unlimited)\n    Proportion float64 // Percentage of available space (0-1)\n    Priority   int     // Truncation priority (higher = truncate first)\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Width calculation algorithm\n```go\nfunc calculateColumnWidths(termWidth int, headers []string, opts TableOptions) []int {\n    // 1. Subtract borders and padding\n    availableWidth := termWidth - (len(headers)*3 + 1) // 3 chars per column for borders\n    \n    // 2. Allocate fixed-width columns first\n    remainingWidth := availableWidth\n    for col, config := range opts.ColumnWidths {\n        if config.Fixed \u003e 0 {\n            remainingWidth -= config.Fixed\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // 3. Distribute remaining width proportionally\n    // 4. Apply min/max constraints\n    // 5. Handle overflow (truncate by priority)\n    \n    return widths\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Smart truncation\nEnhance truncation to be context-aware:\n```go\nfunc truncateForWidth(text string, width int, priority int) string {\n    if len(text) \u003c= width {\n        return text\n    }\n    \n    // Smart truncation based on content type\n    // - URLs: truncate middle (preserve domain/end)\n    // - Paths: truncate middle (preserve start/end)\n    // - Text: truncate end with ellipsis\n    \n    return smartTruncate(text, width)\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Phase\n\n### 1. Add terminal utilities\nCreate `pkg/output/terminal.go`:\n```go\npackage output\n\ntype Terminal struct {\n    width  int\n    height int\n}\n\nfunc NewTerminal() (*Terminal, error) {\n    // Detect terminal size\n    // Handle non-TTY environments (default to 80x24)\n}\n\nfunc (t *Terminal) Size() (width, height int) {\n    return t.width, t.height\n}\n\nfunc (t *Terminal) Watch(callback func(width, height int)) {\n    // Set up SIGWINCH handler\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Enhance TableBuilder\nUpdate `pkg/output/table.go`:\n```go\nfunc (tb *TableBuilder) WithResponsive() *TableBuilder {\n    tb.data.Options.Responsive = true\n    return tb\n}\n\nfunc (tb *TableBuilder) WithColumnConfig(col string, config ColumnWidth) *TableBuilder {\n    if tb.data.Options.ColumnWidths == nil {\n        tb.data.Options.ColumnWidths = make(map[string]ColumnWidth)\n    }\n    tb.data.Options.ColumnWidths[col] = config\n    return tb\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update renderTable\nModify `renderTable()` in `pkg/output/table.go`:\n```go\nfunc renderTable(data *TableData) error {\n    table := tablewriter.NewWriter(os.Stdout)\n    \n    if data.Options.Responsive {\n        term, err := NewTerminal()\n        if err == nil {\n            widths := calculateColumnWidths(term.Size(), data.Headers, data.Options)\n            // Apply widths to tablewriter\n            table.SetColWidth(widths[0]) // etc.\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // ... rest of rendering\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add default column configs\nDefine sensible defaults for common column types:\n```go\nvar DefaultColumnConfigs = map[string]ColumnWidth{\n    \"SYNC\":        {Fixed: 6},          // Icons are fixed width\n    \"TARGETS\":     {MinWidth: 10, MaxWidth: 30, Proportion: 0.2},\n    \"NAME\":        {MinWidth: 15, MaxWidth: 50, Proportion: 0.3},\n    \"DESCRIPTION\": {MinWidth: 20, Proportion: 0.5, Priority: 1}, // Truncate first\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Phase\n\n### 1. Unit tests\nCreate `pkg/output/terminal_test.go`:\n- Test width calculation with various terminal sizes\n- Test column truncation strategies\n- Test min/max width constraints\n\n### 2. Integration tests\nTest with actual commands:\n```bash\n# Simulate different terminal widths\nexport COLUMNS=80  \u0026\u0026 aimgr repo list\nexport COLUMNS=120 \u0026\u0026 aimgr repo list\nexport COLUMNS=200 \u0026\u0026 aimgr repo list\n```\n\n### 3. Edge cases\n- Very narrow terminals (\u003c 40 cols)\n- Very wide terminals (\u003e 200 cols)\n- Non-TTY environments (pipes, redirects)\n- Terminal resize during rendering\n\n## Rollout Phase\n\n### 1. Opt-in by default\nMake responsive mode opt-in initially:\n```go\n// Commands can enable it explicitly\noutput.NewTable(\"Name\", \"Description\").\n    WithResponsive().\n    Format(format)\n```\n\n### 2. Add configuration option\nAdd to `~/.config/aimgr/aimgr.yaml`:\n```yaml\ndisplay:\n  responsive_tables: true\n  min_table_width: 80\n```\n\n### 3. Progressive enhancement\n- Phase 1: Basic width detection (no resize)\n- Phase 2: Add SIGWINCH support (live resize)\n- Phase 3: Add smart truncation\n- Phase 4: Make default for all tables\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- `pkg/output/terminal.go` (new) - Terminal detection utilities\n- `pkg/output/terminal_test.go` (new) - Terminal tests\n- `pkg/output/types.go` - Add ColumnWidth, responsive options\n- `pkg/output/table.go` - Add responsive rendering logic\n- `pkg/output/table_test.go` - Add responsive tests\n- `pkg/config/config.go` - Add display.responsive_tables config\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Tables automatically detect terminal width\n- [ ] Column widths adapt to available space\n- [ ] Minimum column widths are respected\n- [ ] Smart truncation preserves readability\n- [ ] Works in non-TTY environments (pipes/redirects)\n- [ ] SIGWINCH support for live resizing (stretch goal)\n- [ ] Configuration option to enable/disable\n- [ ] Tests cover edge cases (narrow/wide terminals)\n- [ ] Documentation updated with examples\n\n## Dependencies\n- Depends on: ai-config-manager-bjn (table migration)\n- Blocks: None (optional enhancement)\n\n## Notes\n### Non-TTY Behavior\nWhen output is piped or redirected, fall back to default widths:\n- Use 80 column default\n- Disable responsive features\n- Preserve full JSON/YAML output\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- Cache terminal size (don't query on every render)\n- SIGWINCH handler should be lightweight\n- Width calculation should be O(n) where n = column count\n\n### Future Enhancements\n- Column hiding/showing based on width (progressive disclosure)\n- Horizontal scrolling for very narrow terminals\n- Mouse support for interactive column resizing\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hans.kohlreiter@dynatrace.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T20:51:38.280289223+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter","updated_at":"2026-02-11T21:08:33.257564463+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T21:08:33.257564463+01:00","close_reason":"Phase 3 complete: Added basic responsive table infrastructure with terminal size detection, IsTTY checks, and WithResponsive() API.

{"id":"ai-config-manager-qjn","title":"Remove hardcoded truncation during migration","description":"## Description\nMultiple commands have hardcoded `truncateString()` calls (40 or 60 chars) that must be removed during migration to avoid double-truncation. Migration task ai-config-manager-3xk doesn't mention this critical step.\n\n## Affected Files and Lines\n\n**cmd/list_installed.go:**\n- Line 325: `desc := truncateString(cmd.Description, 40)`\n- Line 339: `desc := truncateString(skill.Description, 40)`\n- Line 359: `desc := truncateString(agent.Description, 40)`\n\n**cmd/list.go:**\n- Line ~240: `desc := truncateString(res.Description, 60)` (outputWithPackagesTable)\n- Line ~290: `desc := truncateString(pkg.Description, 60)` (outputPackagesTable)\n\n**cmd/repo_import.go:**\n- Line ~700: `desc := truncateString(res.Description, 60)` (selectResource)\n\n## Why This Matters\nIf hardcoded truncation remains after responsive sizing is implemented:\n1. **Double truncation**: Description gets truncated to 40 chars, then tablewriter truncates again\n2. **Responsive sizing ignored**: Fixed 40-char truncation prevents dynamic column from growing in wide terminals\n3. **Inconsistent behavior**: Some tables respond to terminal width, others don't\n\n## Example Problem\n```go\n// Current code\ndesc := truncateString(cmd.Description, 40)  // ← Truncate to 40\ntable.AddRow(resourceRef, targets, syncSymbol, desc)\n\n// After responsive sizing without removing this\nTerminal width = 120 chars\nDescription column gets 80 chars available\nBut desc is already truncated to 40 chars → wasted space\n```\n\n## Instructions\nWhen migrating each table usage:\n1. **Remove** `truncateString()` calls for the dynamic column (typically Description)\n2. **Keep** truncateString() for fixed columns if needed (rarely required)\n3. Pass full description text to table - let responsive sizing handle truncation\n4. Test that truncation works correctly with \"...\" ellipsis\n\n## Example Migration\n```go\n// BEFORE\ndesc := truncateString(cmd.Description, 40)\ntable.AddRow(resourceRef, targets, syncSymbol, desc)\n\n// AFTER (responsive sizing handles truncation)\ntable.AddRow(resourceRef, targets, syncSymbol, cmd.Description)\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All `truncateString()` calls identified for Description columns\n- [ ] Truncation removed from dynamic columns in all migrated tables\n- [ ] Manual testing confirms:\n  - Wide terminals show more text (no 40-char limit)\n  - Narrow terminals truncate with \"...\"\n  - No double-truncation occurs\n- [ ] Code review confirms no hardcoded limits remain on dynamic columns\n\n## Dependencies\n- Part of migration task scope (ai-config-manager-3xk)\n- This should be added as acceptance criteria to that task\n\n## Priority\nMedium - Required for migration task but won't block implementation task\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hans.kohlreiter@dynatrace.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T11:15:10.505413728+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter","updated_at":"2026-02-13T11:22:06.916604752+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T11:22:06.916604752+01:00","close_reason":"Complete.

contains error messages, status descriptions\n**Special Notes:**\n- Uses tablewriter.NewWriter(os.Stdout) directly\n- Custom .Header() and .Append() methods (not output.NewTable)\n- Already handles variable-length messages properly\n\n#### 2. pkg/output/table.go:81\n**Location:** renderTable() function\n**Purpose:** Generic TableData rendering infrastructure\n**Headers:** Dynamic (passed via TableData.Headers)\n**Context:** Core table rendering used by all output.NewTable() calls\n**Dynamic Column:** Last column by convention\n**Special Notes:**\n- Base infrastructure for all table rendering\n- Converts headers to []any for tablewriter\n- Has responsive sizing logic (currently placeholder)\n\n### output.NewTable() Usage (cmd/)\n\n#### 3. cmd/list.go:227\n**Location:** outputWithPackagesTable() function\n**Purpose:** Repository list command (aimgr repo list)\n**Headers:** Name, Description\n**Context:** Lists all resources in repository with type grouping (commands/skills/agents/packages)\n**Dynamic Column:** Description (2nd/last column)\n**Data:** Resource names, descriptions (truncated to 60 chars)\n**Special Features:**\n- AddSeparator() between resource types\n- Package resources show count: \"5 resources Processes PDF files...\"\n\n#### 4. cmd/list.go:281\n**Location:** outputPackagesTable() function  \n**Purpose:** Package-only list (aimgr repo list package/*)\n**Headers:** Name, Resources, Description\n**Context:** Lists packages with resource counts\n**Dynamic Column:** Description (3rd/last column)\n**Data:** Package name, resource count (number), description (truncated to 60 chars)\n\n#### 5. cmd/list_installed.go:321\n**Location:** outputInstalledTable() function\n**Purpose:** Installed resources list (aimgr list)\n**Headers:** Name, Targets, Sync, Description\n**Context:** Shows installed resources with tool targets and sync status\n**Dynamic Column:** Description (4th/last column)\n**Data:**\n- Name: \"command/test\", \"skill/pdf-processing\"\n- Targets: \"claude, opencode\" (comma-separated)\n- Sync: ✓ * ⚠ - (symbols)\n- Description: Truncated to 40 chars\n**Special Features:**\n- AddSeparator() between resource types\n- Legend printed after table\n\n#### 6. cmd/repo_verify.go:459, 476, 493, 506, 523\n**Location:** displayVerifyResults() function\n**Purpose:** Repository verification (aimgr repo verify)\n**Multiple Tables:**\n\na) **Resources without metadata** (line 459)\n   - Headers: Type, Name, Status\n   - Dynamic Column: Status (3rd/last)\n   - Shows \"Missing metadata\" or \"✓ Created metadata\"\n\nb) **Orphaned metadata** (line 476)\n   - Headers: Type, Name, Status\n   - Dynamic Column: Status (3rd/last)\n   - Shows \"Resource missing\" or \"✓ Removed metadata\"\n\nc) **Missing source paths** (line 493)\n   - Headers: Type, Name, Source Path\n   - Dynamic Column: Source Path (3rd/last)\n   - Shows file paths\n\nd) **Type mismatches** (line 506)\n   - Headers: Name, Resource Type, Metadata Type\n   - Dynamic Column: Metadata Type (3rd/last)\n   - Shows resource type strings\n\ne) **Packages with missing refs** (line 523)\n   - Headers: Package, Missing Count, Missing Resources\n   - Dynamic Column: Missing Resources (3rd/last)\n   - Shows comma-separated list of missing resource refs\n\n### Special Case: Interactive Selector\n\n#### 7. cmd/repo_import.go:694\n**Location:** selectResource() function\n**Purpose:** Interactive resource selection when multiple matches found\n**Headers:** #, Name, Description\n**Context:** User prompt for disambiguation during import\n**Dynamic Column:** Description (3rd/last column)\n**Data:** Index number, resource name, description (truncated to 60 chars)\n**Special Notes:**\n- Not a typical output command\n- Used in interactive prompts only\n- Could benefit from responsive width\n\n### Architecture Notes\n\n**Two Rendering Paths:**\n1. **output.NewTable()** → TableBuilder → TableData → renderTable() → tablewriter\n   - Used by: cmd/list.go, cmd/list_installed.go, cmd/repo_verify.go, cmd/repo_import.go\n   - Consistent API, goes through pkg/output/table.go\n   \n2. **Direct tablewriter** → tablewriter.NewWriter()\n   - Used by: pkg/output/formatter.go (formatAsTable)\n   - Custom .Header() and .Append() methods\n   - Should migrate to output.NewTable() for consistency\n\n### Dynamic Column Pattern\n\n**100% consistency**: All tables use the **last column** as the dynamic column:\n- Descriptions, messages, paths, status text\n- Natural truncation behavior\n- Aligns with user expectations\n\n### Recommendations for Width-Aware Rendering\n\n1. **Priority Order** (implement in this order):\n   - High: cmd/list_installed.go (Description at 40 chars - most constrained)\n   - High: cmd/list.go (Description at 60 chars)\n   - Medium: cmd/repo_verify.go (Multiple tables, various dynamic columns)\n   - Medium: cmd/repo_import.go (Interactive selector)\n   - Low: pkg/output/formatter.go (MESSAGE column - usually short)\n\n2. **Migration Path**:\n   - Keep formatAsTable() as-is (uses custom Header/Append API)\n   - Focus on output.NewTable() callers\n   - Implement width detection in pkg/output/table.go:renderTable()\n   - All output.NewTable() callers inherit automatically\n\n3. **Terminal Width Distribution**:\n   - Reserve space for fixed columns (Name, Targets, Sync, etc.)\n   - Allocate remaining width to last column\n   - Example: 80 chars terminal, 40 chars fixed → 40 chars for description\n   - Example: 120 chars terminal, 40 chars fixed → 80 chars for description\n\n### Files Requiring Changes\n\n**No changes to these files** (when implementing width-aware):\n- cmd/list.go ✓\n- cmd/list_installed.go ✓\n- cmd/repo_verify.go ✓\n- cmd/repo_import.go ✓\n\n**Only change needed:**\n- pkg/output/table.go (renderTable function) - Add width calculation logic\n\nThis architecture allows **zero-change migration** for all table rendering locations.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hans.kohlreiter@dynatrace.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T10:39:15.580940592+01:00","created_by":"Hans Kohlreiter","updated_at":"2026-02-13T11:09:56.735996124+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T11:09:56.735996124+01:00","close_reason":"Comprehensive audit complete.

{"id":"ai-config-manager-ybo","title":"Fix column assignment: move TARGETS/SYNC to correct commands","description":"## Description\nFix the UX issue where `aimgr repo list` shows context-dependent columns (TARGETS/SYNC) that belong in `aimgr list`. This addresses the immediate user confusion while the infrastructure migration proceeds separately.\n\n## Problem\n- `aimgr repo list` shows TARGETS/SYNC that vary by directory (breaks global repo principle)\n- `aimgr list` is missing SYNC column (should show installation sync status)\n\n## Solution\n### 1. Update `cmd/list.go` (repo list)\nRemove context-dependent columns:\n\n**Before:**\n```go\ntable.Header(\"Name\", \"Targets\", \"Sync\", \"Description\")\n```\n\n**After:**\n```go\ntable.Header(\"Name\", \"Description\")\n```\n\nChanges needed:\n- Remove `os.Getwd()` call at line 274\n- Remove `formatInstalledTargets()` calls\n- Remove `formatSyncStatus()` calls\n- Remove `getInstalledTargets()` function (move to list_installed.go)\n- Remove `getSyncStatus()` function (move to list_installed.go)\n- Update help text to remove TARGETS/SYNC documentation\n- Update legend (remove sync symbols explanation)\n\n### 2. Update `cmd/list_installed.go` (list)\nAdd SYNC column to existing TARGETS:\n\n**Before:**\n```go\ntable.Header(\"Name\", \"Targets\", \"Description\")\n```\n\n**After:**\n```go\ntable.Header(\"Name\", \"Targets\", \"Sync\", \"Description\")\n```\n\nChanges needed:\n- Copy `getSyncStatus()` from list.go\n- Copy `formatSyncStatus()` from list.go\n- Add sync column in table building\n- Update help text to document SYNC column\n- Add legend explaining sync symbols\n- Update JSON/YAML output to include sync_status field\n\n### 3. Update ResourceInfo struct\nIn `cmd/list_installed.go`:\n```go\ntype ResourceInfo struct {\n    Type        resource.ResourceType `json:\"type\" yaml:\"type\"`\n    Name        string                `json:\"name\" yaml:\"name\"`\n    Description string                `json:\"description\" yaml:\"description\"`\n    Version     string                `json:\"version,omitempty\" yaml:\"version,omitempty\"`\n    Targets     []string              `json:\"targets\" yaml:\"targets\"`\n    SyncStatus  string                `json:\"sync_status\" yaml:\"sync_status\"` // Add this\n}\n```\n\n## Testing\n### Manual verification:\n```bash\n# Test repo list (should be identical everywhere)\ncd /tmp \u0026\u0026 aimgr repo list\ncd ~/project \u0026\u0026 aimgr repo list\n# Output should be identical\n\n# Test list (should show SYNC status)\ncd ~/project \u0026\u0026 aimgr list\n# Should show: NAME | TARGETS | SYNC | DESCRIPTION\n```\n\n### Expected output:\n\n**`aimgr repo list` (anywhere):**\n```\n┌──────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┐\n│         NAME         │          DESCRIPTION           │\n├──────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┤\n│ skill/skill-creator  │ Guide for creating effective...│\n│ skill/webapp-testing │ Toolkit for interacting with...│\n└──────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**`aimgr list` (in project with .claude/):**\n```\n┌──────────────────────┬─────────┬──────┬─────────────────────┐\n│         NAME         │ TARGETS │ SYNC │     DESCRIPTION     │\n├──────────────────────┼─────────┼──────┼─────────────────────┤\n│ skill/skill-creator  │ claude  │  ✓   │ Guide for creating..│\n│ skill/webapp-testing │ claude  │  *   │ Toolkit for inter.. │\n└──────────────────────┴─────────┴──────┴─────────────────────┘\n\nLegend:\n  ✓ = In sync  * = Not in manifest  ⚠ = Not installed  - = No manifest\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/list.go` - Remove TARGETS/SYNC columns, simplify to NAME/DESCRIPTION\n- `cmd/list_installed.go` - Add SYNC column, copy sync functions from list.go\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `aimgr repo list` shows only NAME, DESCRIPTION\n- [ ] `aimgr repo list` output is identical regardless of current directory\n- [ ] `aimgr list` shows NAME, TARGETS, SYNC, DESCRIPTION\n- [ ] `aimgr list` correctly displays sync status vs ai.package.yaml\n- [ ] No calls to `os.Getwd()` in `cmd/list.go`\n- [ ] Help text updated for both commands\n- [ ] JSON/YAML output includes sync_status field for `aimgr list`\n- [ ] Legend displayed correctly for both commands\n- [ ] Manual testing confirms expected behavior\n\n## Dependencies\n- Blocks: ai-config-manager-t61 (parent bug issue)\n- Independent of: ai-config-manager-bjn (infrastructure migration can happen separately)\n\n## Notes\nThis fix addresses the immediate UX confusion.
